# test-API with node and express

Basic commands:
- Initialize a new project:
  npm init -y
- Install express:
  npm install express
- Update package.json so "main" and "scripts" are ok
- For Azure deployment use PORT = 8080 everywhere
- Don't forget to add environment variables fron local .env to the web app in Azure (in configuration)
- Use azure web apps extension in VS Code for deployment (linux, node 20 LTS, free plan is enough), that worked for me
